# Image Blend Modes in Python

Image blending involves two layers or images that are combined pixel-to-pixel to create a new image. The corresponding pixels of the two layers are combined with the help of a formula.

The notebook in this repository contains Python code to implement three types of blend modes - Multiply, Screen, and Overlay.
